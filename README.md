# UmlautS

A mac-keyboard-layout for german speaking hackers that does not suck.

Its the [us-keyboard-layout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:KB_United_States-NoAltGr.svg) with very few changes:

* your umlauts work with `option-key` / `alt` + location on the german keyboard layout:
    * `option` + `'` = `ä`
    * `option` + `shift` + `'` = `Ä`
    * `option` + `;` = `ö`
    * `option` + `shift` + `;` = `Ö`
    * `option` + `[` = `ü`
    * `option` + `shift` + `[` = `Ü`

## Installation

Copy `UmlautS.keylayout` into `~/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts` and pick `UmlautS` as layout in the preference pane.
